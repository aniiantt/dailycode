Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

给一个相当于按时间顺序排列的公司股票价格的数组，写一个函数计算你买卖一次的最大利润。买必须在卖之前。

举个例子，数组 [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], 应该返回 5，因为你能在 5 元的时候买，在 10 元的时候卖出。
